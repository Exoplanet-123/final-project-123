Final Project: Exoplanet Data Reduction Tool
Hannah Diamond-Lowe & Zakir Gowani

Our functions for calculating the appropriate aperture size can be found in aperture_calculator.py.
Our functions for running our code in parallel (advisable for a full dataset) can be found in parallelizer.py.

To use these two scripts it is necessary for the astropy and mpi packages to be downloaded to your machine.
